# Automated-Research-Podcast-AI-Project

## Objective

The Automated-Research-Podcast-AI-Project is aimed to leverage Notebook LM's capabilities to ingest and analyze research papers, facilitating interactive exploration of complex topics through conversation with the chatbot, ultimately culminating in the creation of informative and engaging podcasts designed to disseminate knowledge in an accessible and alternative learning format.

*Ref 2: Notebook LM with the source you have picked as well as the chat and what will make the convesations that you have with the chat will make into a podcast*

The next step to start asking questions with the chat as well as conversing about the topics in the report. Then take those questions and responses from the chat and save them as notes and add the notes to a source for the podcast.(you can also use a LLM to help you with the questions that you will ask the chat from the specific page in the report)

*Ref 4: Webpage of the notes and sources from the reserach paper that you have created*

- Then you will click on the generate button to create the podcast on the topics that you feed the chat and the source as well as the questions that you asked the chat.
