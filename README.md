*Ref 2: Notebook LM with the source you have picked as well as the chat and what will make the convesations that you have with the chat will make into a podcast*

The next step to start asking questions with the chat as well as conversing about the topics in the report. Then take those questions and responses from the chat and save them as notes and add the notes to a source for the podcast.
